## About Dulaang UP

- Established in 1976 by Tony Mabesa, Dulaang UP is the country’s premiere academic theatre organization. Originally established as the production arm of UP’s Speech Communication and Theatre Arts Program, it has become a quasi-professional group with a regular season. This year, Dulaang UP celebrates its 45th season. 
- Dulaang UP has been a vehicle for seasoned theater artists to articulate their visions and to interact with theater students through productions mounted by veteran directors Tony Mabesa, Anton Juan, Amiel Leonardia, Alexander Cortez, Josefina Estrella, Behn Cervantes and the late Ogie Juliano; guest directors Edgardo dela Cruz, Peter Kern and Floy Quintos; as well as young directors led by Dexter Santos. 
- Through their productions, Metro Manila audiences have witnessed masterworks of the world repertoire. These include works by Shakespeare, Brecht, Ibsen, Chekhov, Moliere, Wilde, Williams, Miller, Lorca and Strindberg, among others.
