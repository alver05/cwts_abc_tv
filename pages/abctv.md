## Meet the Creators!
ABC TV is composed of five (5) members who are second-year undergraduate students from UP Diliman School of Library and Information Studies (SLIS). The digital library serves as their project for Civic Welfare Training Service 2 (CWTS 2) SLIS: Strengthening of a Barangay Library under Prof. Paul Jason Perez.

The name “ABC TV” is inspired by the first letters of the group’s surnames, which are as follows: Ayroso, Bantigue, Calixtro, Tamondong, and Versoza.
