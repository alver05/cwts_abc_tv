## About ABC TV

ABC TV is composed of five (5) members who were second-year undergraduate students from UP Diliman School of Library and Information Studies (SLIS). The digital archives serve as their project for Civic Welfare Training Service 2 (CWTS 2) SLIS: Strengthening of a Barangay Library under Prof. Paul Jason Perez.

The name “ABC TV” is inspired by the first letters of the group’s surnames, which were as follows: Ayroso, Bantigue, Calixtro, Tamondong, and Versoza.
